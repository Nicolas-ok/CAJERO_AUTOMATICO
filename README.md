Handling of multiple users: Allow simultaneous use of the system by multiple users and ensure the integrity of the data.
More account types: Add other types of bank accounts, such as check accounts, investment accounts, etc. and develop the necessary logic to handle them.
Additional features: Add other features to the system, such as the ability to send money to other people, pay for services online, etc.
